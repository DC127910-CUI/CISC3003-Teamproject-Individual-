Our team project is aiming to build a Macau House Rental Platform, an innovative digital solution designed to simplify the property rental process in Macau.  The platform bridges communication between landlords and tenants by providing a range of services to landlords and tenants, simplifying the transaction process. We specialize in developing rental management platforms that allow users to seamlessly manage rental activities through a web interface.  Our platform supports a variety of features, including user authentication, property listings, and account management.  Users can log in or register, view rental listings, adjust filters, and manage their profiles.

# A brief overview of code ideas
Info:The code is used to display and filter web pages of available rental properties, and is mainly written in PHP and HTML. 	When the web page starts, it first confirms the user's login status through PHP session management and obtains user information from the database.
At the top of the page is a navigation bar containing navigation links and user avatars. 
Next is a search box that allows users to enter search terms and use filters. This allows users to quickly find suitable rental options based on their needs.

Detail: The code first starts a session to maintain user status and connects to the database to retrieve information about the currently logged in user. 	The page includes a navigation bar, user avatar, room pictures and detailed introduction. 	If the user is logged in, the user's avatar is displayed; if not logged in, the default avatar is displayed. 		
There is a form at the bottom of the page through which users can view more details of the property and contact the landlord.
Additionally, an interactive search bar is included, allowing users to enter searches. 
The entire page is designed to provide users with detailed house rental information and improve user experience through an intuitive interface.




# Main function
Once logged in, users can use the search and filter functions on the home page to view ideal rental properties. Users are also free to view the information cards listed below.
Using the detail page, users can easily find various information about the house they want.
